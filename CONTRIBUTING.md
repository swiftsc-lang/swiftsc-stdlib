## Code of Conduct

## Standard Library
*   **Pure SwiftSC**: This repo contains `.stc` source files, not Rust.

5.  **Run tests** using `cargo test`.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request** to the `main` branch.

## Coding Standards

*   **Rust**: We use `rustfmt` and `clippy`. Please ensure your code passes `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy`.
*   **Commits**: Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add new parser`, `fix: resolve memory leak`).
